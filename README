espotifai is our take on the mix of social science and the data analyst general toolkit: we used both web scrapping and
the Spotify API to gather data about the most popular music and process it along the data of the World Happiness Index.


We used Python 3.6 to create a SQL database through web scrapping that contains the required info from the World Happiness Index, 
as well as another independent database composed of the top lists of Spotify hits through the Spotify API. 

How does music shapes people? We theorized around this question while working on the graphic visualization made with Tableau, HTML/CSS and Javascript. 
We used clusters.
